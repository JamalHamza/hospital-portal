# Hospital Portal With MERN Stack!

&nbsp;
# Purpose
My purpose of developing this project is to show what I can do both on the frontend and the backend. I would also like to point out that it is my second project as Mern stack.

&nbsp;
# Features

1. **Fully Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure that the application's design adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
   
2. **User Registration and Login with Google Integration:**
   - Implement a secure registration and login system allowing users to create accounts and sign in using traditional credentials or Google authentication for added convenience and security.
   
3. **Specialist Search and Appointment Booking:**
   - Enable patients to search for specific medical specialists and view their availability for booking appointments, facilitating easy scheduling of medical consultations.
   
4. **Appointment Confirmation Email Notification:**
   - Automatically send email notifications to patients upon successful booking of appointments, providing them with confirmation details and appointment reminders.
   
5. **Role-Based Access Control:**
   - Implement role-based access control to distinguish between different user roles, such as doctors, patients, and administrators, ensuring appropriate access levels and permissions for each role.
   
6. **Appointment Cancellation:**
   - Allow patients to cancel their appointments if needed, providing them with flexibility and convenience in managing their schedules.
   
7. **Prevent Double Booking on the Same Day with the Same Doctor:**
   - Implement a validation mechanism to prevent patients from booking multiple appointments with the same doctor on the same day, ensuring fair scheduling and avoiding conflicts.
   
8. **New Device Login Verification via Email Confirmation Code:**
   - Enhance security by sending a verification code to the user's email address when logging in from a new device, ensuring that only authorized users can access their accounts.

   - Enable patients to view their appointment history, including past and upcoming appointments, providing them with a comprehensive overview of their medical visits.

    - Allow doctors to upload, edit, and delete result files such as medical reports and test results, facilitating efficient management of patient records and medical data.
    
11. **Result File Download for Patients:**
    - Enable patients to download their result files from the portal, giving them convenient access to their medical records for reference or sharing with other healthcare providers.
    
12. **Doctor Management by Admin:**
    - Provide administrators with the ability to add and delete doctors from the system, ensuring accurate representation of healthcare providers within the portal.
    
13. **Schedule Management for Doctors by Admin:**
